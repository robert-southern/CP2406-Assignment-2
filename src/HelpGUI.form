          <text value="ABOUT:&#10;Mineral Super Trumps is a card game designed to help players learn about the properties &#10;and uses of common rock-forming minerals.&#10;&#10;The Deck consists of 54 mineral cards, and 6 &quot;supertrump&quot; cards.&#10;&#10;Each mineral card includes information about the mineral as well as further information &#10;in the five playing categories: Hardness, Specific Gravity, Cleavage, Crustal Abundance&#10;and Economic Value.&#10;&#10;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#10;&#10;RULES:&#10;1. Play a card and select a category.&#10;2. Player to the left must play a card with a higher value in the selected category.&#10;3. When the next player can't play, he picks up a card from the deck and passes his turn.&#10;4. If a player has passed, he may not play until all but one player has passed.&#10;5. A player may use a supertrump card at any of their turns; the player changes the&#10;   trump category according to the instructions on the supertrump card. Any player who&#10;   previously passed his turn may play again.&#10;6. Playing the Geophysicist card together with the Magnetite card wins that player the hand.&#10;7. When all but one player has passed his turn, the remaining player gets to lead out the&#10;   next round and chooses the next trump category.&#10;8. The Winner of the game is the first player to lose all of their cards.&#10;9. The game continues until all but one player (the loser) has lost their cards. "/>
